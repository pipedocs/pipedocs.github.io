Pipeline design file
====================

A pipeline design file (`.dsn`) defines a processing pipeline that is interpreted by the image processing system.

The design file contains:

 * A list of the [modules](https://pipedocs.github.io/modules/index.html) that should be executed;
 * The set of parameters that configure each module, as well as their values

## Preparing the design file

There are currently three ways to edit a design file:

 * Manual preparation
 * Direct (runtime) assignment

We strongly recommend you copy and use one of the [standard design files](https://github.com/PennBBL/xcpEngine/tree/master/designs) that come with XCP Engine.
These are regularly tested and usually work.

### Direct (runtime) assignment

What if you have a design file that does almost exactly what you want to do, but requires a few minor tweaks? What if you only want to change the values of one or two variables?

For instance, say that you want to run the same analysis on five different samples of subjects, but each sample has its own [sample-specific template](https://pipedocs.github.io/utils/templateConstruct). You could make five design files -- one for each sample -- and change the value of [`standard`](https://pipedocs.github.io/config/variables/standard.html) to correspond to the appropriate template for each sample. However, in this case, _direct_ or _runtime assignment_ of variables can be an easier and cleaner solution than manually editing the design file.

Direct assignment provides a way to override the values of variables in a design file while keeping the original design file intact. It is invoked by supplying the `-a` flag to the front-end script, `xcpEngine`. The argument supplied to `-a` is the exact substitution that you want to perform. For instance, in order to use the 2mm isotropic OASIS template instead of the template defined in the design file, you could simply provide the illustrated argument without any edits to the design file:
``` bash
-a 'standard=OASIS%2x2x2'
```

Direct assignment enables fewer edits to design files, but a potential disadvantage of this approach is a sacrifice of reproducibility, since any user who wishes to reproduce your analysis exactly must now have access not only to your design file but also to the exact `xcpEngine` command line that you used.

## Examples

A [library of preconfigured pipelines](https://github.com/PennBBL/xcpEngine/tree/master/designs) is available for each of the following experiments:

 * Anatomical (`anat`)
 * Functional connectivity (`fc`)
 * Functional connectivity benchmarking (`qcfc`)

## Specifications (advanced)

Design variables fall into four main categories:

 * _Analysis variables_ are input variables accessible at all stages of the pipeline
 * The _pipeline definition_ specifies the modules (stages) of the pipeline that are to be run
 * _Module variables_ are input variables accessible at only a single stage of the pipeline, and typically configure the behaviour of that pipeline stage
 * _Output variables_ are produced as the pipeline is run and are accessible at all stages of the pipeline
 * A fifth category of variable is not defined in the design file at all. _Subject variables_ take different values for different subjects. See the [cohort file](https://pipedocs.github.io/config/cohort.html) documentation for more information about this type of variable.

### Analysis variables

Each design file includes a set of variables that are accessible at all stages of the pipeline.

``` bash
analysis=accelerator_$(whoami)
design=${XCPEDIR}/designs/fc-36P.dsn
sequence=fc-rest
standard=MNI%2x2x2_via_PNC%2x2x2
```
Documentation for analysis variables will be found below:

 * [analysis](https://pipedocs.github.io/config/variables/analysis.html)
 * [design](https://pipedocs.github.io/config/variables/design.html)
 * [sequence](https://pipedocs.github.io/config/variables/sequence.html)
 * [standard](https://pipedocs.github.io/config/variables/standard.html)

### Pipeline definitions

The design file includes the `pipeline` variable, which defines the backbone of the pipeline: a comma-separated sequence of the [modules](https://pipedocs.github.io/modules/index.html) that together comprise the processing stream. As of v0.6.0, the processing stream is linear and sequential (only one module runs at a time), but future releases will support branching.

The standard [functional connectivity processing stream](https://pipedocs.github.io/config/streams/fc.html) is:
``` bash
pipeline=confound,regress,fcon,reho,alff,net,roiquant,seed,norm,qcfc
```

The standard [benchmarking processing stream](https://pipedocs.github.io/config/streams/qcfc.html) is an abbreviated version of the FC stream:
``` bash
pipeline=confound,regress,fcon,qcfc
```

The complete [anatomical processing stream](https://pipedocs.github.io/config/streams/anat.html) is:
``` bash
pipeline=struc,jlf,gmd,cortcon,sulc,roiquant,qcanat
```

### Module configurations

In addition to the overall backbone of the processing stream, the design file includes specifications for each of its constituent modules. As an illustrative example, the specifications of the `coreg` module in a standard functional connectivity stream are provided here:

``` bash
###################################################################
# 2 COREG
###################################################################

coreg_reference[2]=mean
coreg_cfunc[2]=bbr
coreg_seg[2]=${segmentation[sub]}
coreg_wm[2]=3
coreg_denoise[2]=1
coreg_refwt[2]=NULL
coreg_inwt[2]=NULL
coreg_qacut[2]=0.8,0.9,0.7,0.8
coreg_decide[2]=1
coreg_mask[2]=0
coreg_rerun[2]=0
coreg_cleanup[2]=1
```

Each row defines a different parameter for the `coreg` module (e.g., `coreg_cfunc` -- the cost function for registration) and assigns it a value (e.g., `bbr` -- boundary-based registration). When the module is executed, it processes its inputs according to the specifications in the pipeline design file. Documentation for each module's configuration options will be found in the [modules directory](https://pipedocs.github.io/modules/index.html).

### Output variables

Output variables aren't defined in the design file that's provided as an argument at runtime. Instead, they are defined as the pipeline is run and written to a copy of the design file. Output variables are typically accessible by all pipeline stages after they are produced. An illustrative example is provided, again for the `coreg` module:

``` bash
# ··· outputs from IMAGE COREGISTRATION MODULE[2] ··· #
struct2seq_img[9001]=accelerator/9001/coreg/9001_struct2seq.nii.gz
struct2seq_mat[9001]=accelerator/9001/coreg/9001_struct2seq.mat
seq2struct[9001]=accelerator/9001/coreg/9001_seq2struct.txt
seq2struct_img[9001]=accelerator/9001/coreg/9001_seq2struct.nii.gz
struct2seq[9001]=accelerator/9001/coreg/9001_struct2seq.txt
seq2struct_mat[9001]=accelerator/9001/coreg/9001_seq2struct.mat
fit[9001]=0.3
sourceReference[9001]=accelerator/9001/prestats/9001_meanIntensityBrain.nii.gz
targetReference[9001]=9001_antsct/ExtractedBrain0N4.nii.gz
altreg2[9001]=mutualinfo
altreg1[9001]=corratio
```

Each row corresponds to an output defined by the `coreg` module that can be used by all downstream modules. For example, `struct2seq` defines an affine transformation from the subject's high-resolution anatomical space to the subject's functional space. This transformation can later be used to align white matter and CSF masks to the functional image, enabling tissue-based confound regression.
