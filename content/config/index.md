Pipeline configuration
======================

This page includes links to everything needed to get started with the pipeline system.

The system's front end, `xcpEngine`, accepts two primary arguments: a design file and a cohort file.

 * The [design file](%%BASEURL/config/design.html) parametrises the processing streams and specifies the [modules](%%BASEURL/modules/index.html) that should be run.
 * The [cohort file](%%BASEURL/config/cohort.html) is a list of subjects; it defines the inputs to the pipeline.
