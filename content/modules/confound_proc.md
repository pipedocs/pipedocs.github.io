# `confound`: Confound/nuisance model module

`confound` models artefactual signals present in a 4D time series image. The confound model created by this module can be used to mitigate effects of subject motion and other artefactual processes by residualising the 4D image with respect to the confound model. (The regression/residualisation procedure is managed separately in the `regress` module.) Several types of artefact can be modelled: physiological sources, including white matter and CSF signals; global signal; realignment parameters; and signals derived from principal component analysis (PCA, CompCor). Derivatives and squares can also be added to the confound model, as can signal during prior time points.

If you wish to include confounds based on segmentation of T1-weighted tissue (including WM- and CSF-based signals), you must run `coreg` first.

## Model construction order

Currently, the confound model is assembled in the following order:

1. Doggos of puppington fame
1. Add realignment parameters and mean time series from GM, WM, CSF, and global
2. Add temporal derivatives of any time series in the model
3. Add powers of any time series in the model (e.g., quadratic terms)
4. Add component-based time series (CompCor)
5. Add custom time series

So, for instance, including the second power will also include not only the squared time series, but also the squares of derivatives.

In the future, a control sequence will probably be implemented to support greater flexibility in confound models.

## Module configuration

### `confound_rp`

_Realignment parameters._

Early models that attempted to correct for the introduction of spurious variance by the movement of subjects in the scanner did so by regressing out the 6 parameters (3 translational, 3 rotational) used to realign each volume in the time series to a reference volume. Later work has demonstrated that a model consisting of realignment parameters alone is ineffective at removing motion artefact from functional MR time series.

```bash
# Use realignment parameters
confound_rp[cxt]=1

# No realignment parameters
confound_rp[cxt]=0
```

### `confound_rms`

_Relative RMS displacement_

The relative root-mean-square displacement is estimated by FSL's MCFLIRT. This is equivalent to the Jenkinson formulation of framewise displacement and is approximately double the Power formulation of framewise displacement. Using the relative RMS displacement as a confound time series is not recommended; this is an uncommon denoising strategy and is not likely to be effective.

```bash
# Use RMS displacement
confound_rms[cxt]=1

# No RMS displacement
confound_rms[cxt]=0
```

### `confound_gm`, `confound_wm`, and `confound_csf`

_Tissue-based nuisance regressors._

Tissue-based nuisance regressors are capable of reducing the influence of subject movement (as well as physiological artefacts) on the data. Mean white matter and cerebrospinal fluid signal are most often used to this end (e.g., Windischberger et al., 2002; Satterthwaite et al., 2012), but principal component analysis can also be used to extract signals of no interest from anatomical compartments (Behzadi et al., 2007: aCompCor). This approach requires a known segmentation of the anatomical image into tissue classes. If you provided an output directory from the ANTsCT routine or the anatomical stream, then a segmentation will automatically be available as the derivative `segmentation`.

```bash
# Do not use any white matter signals
confound_wm[cxt]=0

# Use the mean white matter signal
confound_wm[cxt]=mean

# Use the first 5 principal components from white matter (aCompCor)
confound_wm[cxt]=5

# Use the first n principal components, where n components are sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance in the white matter
confound_wm[cxt]=0.5
```

 * `mean` indicates that the mean time series over all voxels inside the tissue boundaries should be used in the confound model.
 * A positive numeric value indicates that principal component analysis (PCA) over all voxels inside the tissue boundaries should be used to obtain nuisance time series.
 * If the value is an integer _n_, then the first _n_ component time series will be added to the nuisance model.
 * If the value is a fractional value _k_ between 0 and 1, then the first _n_ component time series will be added to the nuisance model, where _n_ is the minimum number of components necessary to explain _k_ of the variance in the signal within the component boundaries. For instance, _k_ of `0.5` corresponds to 50 percent variance explained.

Use of tissue-based nuisance regressors requires a known segmentation of the anatomical image into tissue classes. If you provided an output directory from the ANTsCT routine or the anatomical stream, then a segmentation will automatically be available as the derivative `segmentation`. In some segmentations, such as the one output by ANTs Cortical Thickness, each tissue class is assigned a different intensity value in the segmentation volume. For instance, 1 might correspond to CSF, 2 to cortical grey matter, 3 to white matter, etc. If your segmentation is strictly a binary-valued white matter mask, then enter `ALL`. To enter a range of values, use the colon (`:`) delimiter; to enter multiple values, use the comma (`,`) delimiter.

```bash
# Use a custom segmentation for WM
confound_wm_path[cxt]=/path/to/segmentation.nii.gz

# Use the segmentation from ANTsCT or the anatomical stream for WM
confound_wm_path=${segmentation[sub]}

# Use the mean CSF signal. Use the pipeline segmentation for CSF. 1=CSF in the provided CSF segmentation path.
confound_csf[cxt]=mean
confound_csf_path[cxt]=${segmentation[sub]}
confound_csf_val[cxt]=1
```

In order to ensure that the signal extracted from the tissue or region of interest is not mixed with signal from adjacent voxels associated with a different tissue class (partial volume effects), it is possible to erode its mask by removing fringe voxels. An optimal degree of erosion will result in a mask comprising 'deep' voxels of the tissue, while excessive erosion may result in a mask whose extent is poorly representative of the tissue. For functional connectivity analysis, more aggressive erosion of WM and CSF masks is recommended to reduce collinearity of WM and CSF signal with global and GM signals. Erosion to a target range of 5 to 10 percent is recommended in this case.

```bash
# Erode CSF mask to the deepest 10 percent
confound_csf_ero[cxt]=10

# Erode WM mask to the deepest 5 percent
confound_wm_ero[cxt]=5
```

The value of `confound_<tissue>_ero` specifies the level of erosion that is to be applied to tissue masks. Allowable values range from 0 to 100 and reflect the minimum percentage of tissue remaining after erosion cycles have been applied. For instance, a value of 30 indicates that the tissue mask should be eroded to 30 percent its original size; that is, the mask will comprise only the deepest 30 percent of voxels with the tissue classification. (Depth is computed using `ImageMath` from ANTs, and the erosion is implemented in the utility `erodespare`.)

For advanced users: The `confound` module offers the option of including up to three tissue- or RoI-based regressors. While nominally these are the mean GM, WM, and CSF timeseries, it is possible to include signals from any three RoIs for which a binary mask is available by assigning the appropriate value to the `<tissue>_path` variable.

### `confound_gsr`

_Global signal regression._

Removal of the mean signal across the entire brain is one of the simplest and most effective means of attenuating the influence of artefactual sources such as subject motion. While earlier studies suggested that global signal regression might be harmful, for instance by introducing artefactual anticorrelations (Murphy et al., 2009) or group differences (Saad et al., 2012), an emerging consensus (e.g., Power et al., 2014; Chai et al., 2012) suggests instead that it is uniquely effective in removing widespread forms of artefact (due to both motion and physiological processes such as respiration).

```bash
# Enable GSR (recommended for functional connectivity analysis)
confound_gsr[cxt]=mean

# Disable GSR
confound_gsr[cxt]=0
```

### `confound_<tissue>_rad`

_Local/voxelwise regressors._

In addition to standard confound regression procedures that use the same nuisance model across all voxels, it is possible to adapt the nuisance model spatially by using voxelwise or local regressors. For a given voxel, a local regressor can be obtained by computing the mean signal in only WM or CSF voxels within a certain radius of that voxel (similar to the ANATICOR approach; Jo et al., 2013). Local regression models artefactual signals present in a 4D image on a voxelwise basis. Local white matter signal is most often used to this end (e.g., Jo et al., 2013). `confound_<tissue>_rad` will require a segmentation of the subject's anatomical image according to tissue class. Modelled artefact can then be removed from the image using the REGRESS module. For instance, this module can model each voxel's local white matter and CSF signal for subsequent removal. Because this option requires a structural segmentation, the `coreg` module should generally be run as a prerequisite.

```bash
# Use the local WM signal within a 20 mm radius as a voxelwise regressor
confound_wm[cxt]=local
confound_wm_rad[cxt]=20

# Use the local CSF signal within a 15 mm radius as a voxelwise regressor
confound_csf[cxt]=local
confound_csf_rad[cxt]=15

# Use the local mean signal within a 6 mm radius as a voxelwise regressor (don't do this)
confound_gsr[cxt]=local
confound_lms_rad[cxt]=6
```

Caution:

If you elect to model the overall local signal (or the local GM signal), it is possible that you will remove more signal than noise. Spatial smoothing is thought to improve the signal-to-noise ratio by averaging signal in adjacent voxels. This option, by contrast, removes signal that is common to nearby voxels. The outcome is untested and probably dependent on the voxel neighbourhood size.

### `confound_cc`

_tCompCor._

The temporal component-based correction approach (tCompCor: Behzadi et al., 2007) extracts signals of no interest from high-variance voxels using principal component analysis (PCA). These noise components are then added to the nuisance model. Temporal CompCor signals are extracted from the image using `ImageMath` in ANTs. `confound_cc` must be a nonnegative integer.

```bash
# Disable tCompCor
confound_cc[cxt]=0

# Use the first 5 tCompCor components
confound_cc[cxt]=5
```

Note: This option enables the temporal variance-based CompCor approach. To use the anatomical CompCor (aCompCor) approach instead, see `confound_gm`, `confound_wm`, and `confound_csf`.

### `confound_past`

_Expansion: previous time points._

Including forward-shifted realignment and nuisance timeseries in the nuisance model (Friston et al., 1996) provides a means of factoring in the subject's history of motion and for the lingering effects of motion, which may persist for upwards of 10 seconds following motion itself. `confound_past` must be a nonnegative integer.

```bash
# Include no previous time points
confound_past[cxt]=0

# Include previous time point
confound_past[cxt]=1

# Include previous 2 time points
confound_past[cxt]=2
```

Note: Do not include both previous time points (`confound_past`) and temporal derivatives (`confound_dx`) in the same model. Together with the original time series, they form a collinear triple, which will result in an overspecified model. That is to say, for a time series T, its temporal derivative D, and previous/shifted time series P,

D + P = T

### `confound_dx`

_Expansion: temporal derivatives._

Temporal derivatives of motion parameters encode the relative displacement of the brain from one volume of a timeseries to the next; they are used in major confound models (e.g., Satterthwaite et al., 2012). `confound_dx` must be a nonnegative integer.

```bash
# Include no temporal derivatives
confound_past[cxt]=0

# Include first temporal derivative
confound_past[cxt]=1

# Include first and second temporal derivatives
confound_past[cxt]=2
```

Note: Do not include both previous time points (`confound_past`) and temporal derivatives (`confound_dx`) in the same model. Together with the original time series, they form a collinear triple, which will result in an overspecified model. That is to say, for a time series T, its temporal derivative D, and previous/shifted time series P,

D + P = T

### `confound_sq`

_Expansion: powers (quadratic, cubic, quartic, etc.)._

In addition to the first power of each confound, you may elect to include higher powers to account for potential noise that is proportional to squares or higher powers of motion parameters and nuisance regressors. 

```bash
# First power only
confound_sq[cxt]=1

# First power and quadratic expansion
confound_sq[cxt]=2

# First power, quadratic and cubic expansions
confound_sq[cxt]=3
```

### `confound_custom`

_Custom regressors._

In addition to regressors generated from the image data, custom regressors can be added to the nuisance model. For instance, these might include respiratory traces convolved with an appropriate response function or estimates of task-driven activity. Custom regressors should be formatted as a matrix with regressor time series in columns and time points/frames in rows.

```bash
# No custom regressors
confound_custom[cxt]=

# Include a custom regressor file
confound_custom[cxt]=/path/to/custom/file.1D

# Include custom regressors in multiple files
confound_custom[cxt]=/path/tocustom/file_1.1D,/path/to/custom/file_2.1D
```

### `confound_rerun`

Ordinarily, each module will detect whether a particular analysis has run to completion before beginning it. If re-running is disabled, then the module will immediately skip to the next stage of analysis. Otherwise, any completed analyses will be repeated.If you change the run parameters, you should rerun any modules downstream of the change.

```bash
# Skip processing steps if the pipeline detects the expected output
confound_rerun[cxt]=0

# Repeat all processing steps
confound_rerun[cxt]=1
```

### `confound_cleanup`

Modules often produce numerous intermediate temporary files and images during the course of an analysis. In many cases, these temporary files are undesirable and unnecessarily consume disk space. If cleanup is enabled, any files stamped as temporary will be deleted when a module successfully runs to completion. If a module fails to detect the output that it expects, then temporary files will be retained to facilitate error diagnosis.

```bash
# Remove temporary files
confound_cleanup[cxt]=1

# Retain temporary files
confound_cleanup[cxt]=0
```

### Example configuration: 36-parameters model

The 36-parameter confound model includes 6 realignment parameters, mean WM and CSF time series, and global signal regression (9 parameters). Additionally, the 36-parameter model includes temporal derivatives of these 9 time series (+9) and squares of the original 9 parameters and of their temporal derivatives (+18) for a total of 36 parameters. As an illustrative example for `confound` module configuration, the variable settings for configuring a 36-parameter model are shown here. The example configuration uses a standard 6-class segmentation, such as that output by the ANTs Cortical Thickness pipeline when provided appropriate priors.
