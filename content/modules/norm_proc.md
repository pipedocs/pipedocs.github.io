# `norm`: Image normalisation module

`norm` moves 4D timeseries from acquisition space into a standard space. It is only compatible with ITK-/ANTs-based transforms at this time. Before running normalisation, you must run coregistration to compute a transformation from the subject's functional image to the subject's anatomical image. It may also be necessary to compute a warp from the subject's anatomical image to a template in the target standard space.

This module is not configurable at this time. Near-term customisability includes:

 * A multiplicity of target spaces for registrations
 * The option to disable registration of the primary analyte (since this often unnecessarily consumes disk space) and normalise only derivative images

### `norm_rerun`

Ordinarily, each module will detect whether a particular analysis has run to completion before beginning it. If re-running is disabled, then the module will immediately skip to the next stage of analysis. Otherwise, any completed analyses will be repeated.If you change the run parameters, you should rerun any modules downstream of the change.

```bash
# Skip processing steps if the pipeline detects the expected output
norm_rerun[cxt]=0

# Repeat all processing steps
norm_rerun[cxt]=1
```

### `norm_cleanup`

Modules often produce numerous intermediate temporary files and images during the course of an analysis. In many cases, these temporary files are undesirable and unnecessarily consume disk space. If cleanup is enabled, any files stamped as temporary will be deleted when a module successfully runs to completion. If a module fails to detect the output that it expects, then temporary files will be retained to facilitate error diagnosis.

```bash
# Remove temporary files
norm_cleanup[cxt]=1

# Retain temporary files
norm_cleanup[cxt]=0
```
