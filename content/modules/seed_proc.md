# `seed`: Seed-based correlation analysis module

`seed` performs seed-based correlation analyses given a seed region or set of seed regions. For each seed region, which may be provided either as a 3D volume in NIfTI format or as coordinates in a library file, `seed` computes the pairwise connectivity between each voxel and the seed region, for instance using the Pearson correlation coefficient between timeseries (Biswal et al., 1995).

### `seed_lib`

_Spatial coordinates library._

The spatial coordinates library (`.sclib`) is a file containing an index of the seed regions for which the correlation analysis should be run. Each seed is represented by a line in the `sclib` file that begins with the `#` (hash/octothorpe) character. Seeds can be denoted using spatial coordinates or using volumetric NIfTI images. If this field is left blank, then no seed-based correlation analysis will be performed.

```bash
# Use posterior_cingulate.sclib
seed_lib[cxt]=posterior_cingulate.sclib

# Skip seed-based correlation analysis
seed_lib[cxt]=
```

### `seed_sptf` and `seed_smo`

_Spatial smoothing parameters._

Endemic noise, for instance due to physiological signals or scanner activity, can introduce spurious or artefactual results in single voxels. The effects of noise-related artefacts can be mitigated by spatially filtering the data, thus dramatically increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. However, spatial smoothing is not without its costs: it effectively reduces volumetric resolution by blurring signals from adjacent voxels. The spatial smoothing implemented in the `seed` module (i) keeps the unsmoothed analyte image for downstream use and (ii) creates a derivative image that is smoothed using the specified kernel. This allows either the smoothed or the unsmoothed version of the image to be used in any downstream modules as appropriate.
 
```bash
# No smoothing
seed_sptf[cxt]=none
seed_smo[cxt]=0

# Gaussian kernel (fslmaths) of FWHM 6 mm
seed_sptf[cxt]=gaussian
seed_smo[cxt]=6

# SUSAN kernel (FSL's SUSAN) of FWHM 4 mm
seed_sptf[cxt]=susan
seed_smo[cxt]=4

# Uniform kernel (AFNI's 3dBlurToFWHM) of FWHM 5 mm
seed_sptf[cxt]=uniform
seed_smo[cxt]=5
```

`seed_sptf` specifies the type of spatial filter to apply for smoothing, while `seed_smo` specifies the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the smoothing kernel in mm.

 * Gaussian smoothing applies the same Gaussian smoothing kernel across the entire volume.
 * SUSAN-based smoothing restricts mixing of signals from disparate tissue classes (Smith and Brady, 1997).
 * Uniform smoothing applies smoothing to all voxels until the smoothness computed at every voxel attains the target value.
 * Uniform smoothing may be used as a compensatory mechanism to reduce the effects of subject motion on the final processed image (Scheinost et al., 2014).

### `seed_rerun`

Ordinarily, each module will detect whether a particular analysis has run to completion before beginning it. If re-running is disabled, then the module will immediately skip to the next stage of analysis. Otherwise, any completed analyses will be repeated.If you change the run parameters, you should rerun any modules downstream of the change.

```bash
# Skip processing steps if the pipeline detects the expected output
seed_rerun[cxt]=0

# Repeat all processing steps
seed_rerun[cxt]=1
```

### `seed_cleanup`

Modules often produce numerous intermediate temporary files and images during the course of an analysis. In many cases, these temporary files are undesirable and unnecessarily consume disk space. If cleanup is enabled, any files stamped as temporary will be deleted when a module successfully runs to completion. If a module fails to detect the output that it expects, then temporary files will be retained to facilitate error diagnosis.

```bash
# Remove temporary files
seed_cleanup[cxt]=1

# Retain temporary files
seed_cleanup[cxt]=0
```
